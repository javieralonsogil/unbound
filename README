How to run:

You need:
* Python
* Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org)
* Redis (http://redis.io)
* python redis bindings (http://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py)
* SQLite (http://sqlite.org)

Code should be considered development quality with no error checking.

To run:
1. Start redis
2. cd to base code directory (eg. src should be immediate sub directory)
3. Run `python src/app.py`
    a. this should tell you what port the app is running on
4. Use src/{fake_clear,fake_event}.py to generate fake events for profile etc.
